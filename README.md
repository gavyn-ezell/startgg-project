# startgg-project

**Description**

Site/dashboard for avid SSBU tournament watchers and fans.
Allows fans to have a personalized dashboard, showing card summaries of their favorite players, with information
such as recent results, and upcoming tournaments. Users can then set up a notification system for current players on their dashboard, where they are notified when an upcoming tournament with that respective player starts.

_Current version can only make individual searches for a player, one a time_
